    If `charset` is given, we simply assume that encoding for the text,
    but we'll use the "replace" mode so that the decoding will always
    succeed.
    If `charset` is ''not'' specified, we'll make some guesses, first
    trying the UTF-8 encoding, then trying the locale preferred encoding,
    in "replace" mode. This differs from the `unicode` builtin, which
    by default uses the locale preferred encoding, in 'strict' mode,
    and is therefore prompt to raise `UnicodeDecodeError`s.

    Because of the "replace" mode, the original content might be altered.
    If this is not what is wanted, one could map the original byte content
    by using an encoding which maps each byte of the input to an unicode
    character, e.g. by doing `unicode(text, 'iso-8859-1')`.
